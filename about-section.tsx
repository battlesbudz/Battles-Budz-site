                <strong className="text-battles-black">Justin Battles</strong> first turned to cannabis at 14 as the only thing that helped him feel calm and focused. Later, during his eight years in the Army, he was diagnosed with ADHD and tried medications like Adderall and Ritalin, but they didn't help. They killed his appetite, caused insomnia, and left him unfocused.
              </p>

              <p>
                During his military service, Justin injured his knees jumping out of planes, leading to his medical retirement. Cannabis was the one thing that helped him manage pain and stay clear-headed, inspiring him to learn everything he could about the plant.
              </p>

              <p>
                That passion led him to study cultivation and processing and grow medical cannabis for himself and his wife. At Battles Budz, Justin oversees cultivation and product creation, channeling his military discipline into building a business that serves the community with integrity.
